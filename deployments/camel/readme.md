## Camel Toolbox Customizations

The following services have been configured with Fedora credentials:
* Solr indexer
* Triplestore indexer
* Fixity service
* Serialization service
* Reindexing service

The Solr indexer has been configured to communicate with Solr running on port 8080, instead of the default 8983.

The triplestore indexer has been configured to NOT include any `Prefer` headers. The production default is to limit the triples to be indexed by omitting `ldp:contains` triples.

The reindexing service has been configured to bind to the host, `0.0.0.0`, instead of the default `localhost`. This allows the reindexing service to be accessible from outside of the host machine. See [camel-jetty documentation](http://camel.apache.org/jetty.html), search for: "Usage of localhost".
